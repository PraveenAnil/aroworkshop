LAB 3 : CI/CD 
## 3.1 CI/CD Demo Overview 

With Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, you can accelerate the development and deliver of your microservices. Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides seamless supports to open source DevOps & CICD tools, like Jenkins, Nexus, GitHub and SonarQube.

### The OpenShift CI/CD Demo

In this lab, you'll deploy a complete CI/CD demo on Azure Red Hat OpenShift. 

Following components will be deployed onto your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

- A sample Java application, the source code is available at https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-tasks
- A sample OpenShift Pipeline, a pre-defined CI/CD pipeline on ARO.
- Jenkins, open source CI/CD engine and automation server.
- Nexus, software artifact repository.
- SonarQube, code quality platform.
- Gogs, a self-hosted Git service.
- PostgreSQL, open source RDBMS database.
- Eclipse Che, web based Eclipse IDE.

The following diagram shows the steps included in the deployment pipeline:

On every pipeline execution, the code goes through the following steps:

- Code is cloned from Gogs, built, tested and analyzed for bugs and bad patterns
- The WAR artifact is pushed to Nexus Repository manager
- A container image (tasks:latest) is built based on the Tasks application WAR artifact deployed on WildFly
- The Tasks app container image is pushed to the internal image registry
- The Tasks container image is deployed in a fresh new container in DEV project
- If tests successful, the pipeline is paused for the release manager to approve the release to STAGE
- If approved, the DEV image is tagged in the STAGE project
- The staged image is deployed in a fresh new container in the STAGE project
